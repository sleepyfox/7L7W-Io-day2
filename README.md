Code Dojo - Seven Languages in Seven Weeks
===
This is example code for the London Code Dojo's "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks" series of dojos following Bruce Tate's book of the same name; this dojo corresponds to the second day of the [Io](http://iolanguage.org/) programming language chapter.

I will link the [slides](http://speakerdeck.com/sleepyfox/london-code-dojo-7l7w-io-day-2) from the meeting. You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
